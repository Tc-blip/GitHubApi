I think to develop a code that can be easily tested, the most important thing is to write a clear structured code and write as many functions as possible, so that it can be easier to test each function separately.


When testing this code, the biggest difficulty is how do I ensure that my expect output is correct. I need to manually find the expected result by myself. It is difficult and cannot be guaranteed to be correct.
